# Weaviate Genesis Server

The Genesis Serer is the discovery system for the Peer to Peer system.  This small centralized service makes weviate a [Hybrid P2P system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#Hybrid_models)
Full P2P distributed systems have issues to find their peers, whilst in fully centralized systems the central parts form a bottle neck.
