// VectorWeights Allow custom overrides of vector weights as math expressions. E.g. "pancake": "7" will set the weight for the word pancake to 7 in the vectorization, whereas "w * 3" would triple the originally calculated word. This is an open object, with OpenAPI Specification 3.0 this will be more detailed. See Weaviate docs for more info. In the future this will become a key/value (string/string) object.
