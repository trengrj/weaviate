# FAQ

Q: Why would I use a knowledge graph?<br>
A: Knowledge Graphs are great to relate and give context to data. Most databases don't do this making it hard to create multiple use cases on a single dataset.

Q: Can you give an example of a knowledge graph?<br>
A: Yes, Google Search, just type in: _What languages does Queen Maxima speak?_ You'll get the following answer: _Dutch is the Queen's third language; she is also fluent in Spanish (her native language) and English. She speaks French to a conversational level._. We want to bring similar technology to you.

Q: Why is Weaviate decentralised?<br>
A: Having one knowledge graph is great, have `n+1` knowledge graphs is even greater. 

Q: What is the end goal of Weaviate<br>
A: You can read that in our [vision document]().
