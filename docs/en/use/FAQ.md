## Q: Why would I use a knowledge graph?

Knowledge Graphs are really good at giving you a 360 degrees representation of your data. This is useful because a knowledge graph can be used for almost any use case you can imagine!

- Are you creating a digital twin of a rocket ship?
- Are you building a webshop?
- Are you creating a search engine?
- Want to map out your security landscape?
- Want to manage a master dataset? 
- Building machine learning models for many different use cases?

You can do all these things with one single knowledge graph!

## Q: Why would I use Weaviate?

Besides all the power of a knowledge graph (as mentioned above), Weaviate adds three more unique features to the mix.

**1. Semantic understanding of your data through The Contextionary**

The Contextionary is a natural language (NLP) tool based on word vectorization. When creating the Weaviate knowledge graph, all data is interpreted and related. For example, this allows Weaviate to understand the difference between `apple`  the company and `apple` the fruit.

**2. A Focus on developer user experience**

Graph databases are sometimes tricky to use and query. Weaviate takes all that abstraction away by offering you access to the graph through the RESTful API and the GraphQL query language. When you run Weaviate, you can immediately start using it!

**3. Peer to peer network**

With Weaviate you can not only create a knowledge graph, but you can also create a knowledge network! Within Weaviate you can extend your network outside the one single knowledge graph. This might be handy for -but not limited too-; creating cross-company knowledge networks, creating cross-university knowledge networks, cross-self-driving car knowledge networks, etcetera.

**4. Scale**

Weaviate scales BIG! Our benchmarks are now up to 5 billion nodes.
