## Q: Why would I use a knowledge graph?

Knowledge Graphs are really good at giving you a 360 degrees representation of your data. This is useful because a knowledge graph can be used for almost any use case you can imagine!

- Are you creating a digital twin of a rocket ship?
- Are you building a webshop?
- Are you creating a search engine?
- Want to map out your security landscape?
- Want to manage a master dataset? 
- Building machine learning models for many different use cases?

You can do all these things with one single knowledge graph!

## Q: Why would I use Weaviate?

Besides all the power of a knowledge graph (as mentioned above), Weaviate adds three more unique features to the mix.

**1. Semantic understanding of your data through The Contextionary**

The Contextionary is a natural language (NLP) tool based on word vectorization. When creating the Weaviate knowledge graph, all data is interpreted and related. For example, this allows Weaviate to understand the difference between `apple`  the company and `apple` the fruit.

**2. A Focus on developer user experience**

Graph databases are sometimes tricky to use and query. Weaviate takes all that abstraction away by offering you access to the graph through the RESTful API and the GraphQL query language. When you run Weaviate, you can immediately start using it!

**3. Peer to peer network**

With Weaviate you can not only create a knowledge graph, but you can also create a knowledge network! Within Weaviate you can extend your network outside the one single knowledge graph. This might be handy for -but not limited too-; creating cross-company knowledge networks, creating cross-university knowledge networks, cross-self-driving car knowledge networks, etcetera.

**4. Scale**

Weaviate scales BIG! Our benchmarks are now up to 5 billion nodes.

## Q: Why can't I use a normal relational or key-value database?

Traditional datastores are great at storing data for a single use case. The power of Weaviate lies in the fact that it becomes super easy to build a tremendous amount of use cases on a single data sources. You easily can keep adding logic and data in a multitude of directions.

To compare, if a relational would be 2 dimensional, a knowledge graph such as Weaviate would be 3 dimensional.

## Q: What is the Contextionary?

Weaviate's Contextioxtionary is a natural language processing tool that gives context to the knowledge graph. It puts the word "knowledge" in "knowledge graph" and you can read more about it [here](https://www.semi.network/knowledge-base/wiki-semi-consulting/learn/technology-summary/#contextionary).

## Q: What does the standard contextionary consists of?

It is trained on the WikiPedia corpus but we also offer custom contextionaries. Reach out [here](https://www.semi.network/contact/) for more information.

## Q: Is there a Graphical Userinterface (GUI)

Yes! We are working on a GUI called: Weaviate Playground which we will release in a few months to the public.

## Q: Can you give an example of a knowledge graph?

[Google Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph)

## Q: Graphs are kinda difficult, is Weaviate difficult to use?

Nope! Our aim is to give developers a superior user experience. We do this by giving you access to the knowledge graph through [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

## Q: Graphs are difficult to scale, what about Weaviate?

As part of our quest for a superior developer experience, we focus on scaling the graph for you out of the box. If you want to dive deeper into the connectors, you can find the available database connectors [here](../../../database/connectors).

## Q: How is Weaviate different from a data lake?

Data lakes consist of unstructured data. With Weaviate we aim to achieve the exact opposite, namely _hyper structured data_. The data you store in Weaviate is hyper-structured.

## Q: Why is Weaviate decentralised, what does the P2P Network do?

Creating a huge knowledge graph with Weaviate is one thing, but what if you could combine multiple knowledge graphs into one single knowledge network? That is exactly the goal of Weaviate's P2P networking, it will enable you to collaborate with others or create custom knowledge architectures.

## Q: Whats libraries and tools does Weaviate consume.

A handy overview of dependencies can be found [here](../../../LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md).

## Q: What is the end goal of Weaviate

We believe that all data related tasks can be solved with simple machine powered question answering.

## Q: What?! Do you really think you can do this ⤴️

Yes!
