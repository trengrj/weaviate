# Authorization

> Purpose: about authorization in Weaviate.

Authorization is currently being reworked, we want to be as flexible as
possible while supporting standard auth schemes out-of-the-box. You can read
more about the current [Authentication and Authorization
proposal](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/issues/628) here.
