_The Decentralized Knowledge Graph & The Decentralized Knowledge P2P Network_

## Introduction

Weaviate is a knowledge graph which meshes all your data and makes it available as one seamless source for contextualized research, reporting, and re-use. Our aim is to transform static (big-)data into a natural language queryable knowledge base which you can access directly or over a peer-to-peer network.

### Technical features

Weaviate comes with a variety of features and is based on specific design principles.

Key features of Weaviate include:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="25%"><b>Contextual</b></td>
    <td>The Contextionary is a fast and powerful natural language processing tool which combines multiple uni-directional word embeddings, bi-directional word embeddings and other NLP tools to achieve production-ready machine comprehension tasks. You can read more about the Contextionary <a href="./docs/en/contribute/contextionary.md">here</a> and the roadmap for new features is located <a href="./docs/en/contribute/roadmap.md">here</a>.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Contextual ontologies</b></td>
    <td>Weaviate's ontologies are completely contextual, meaning that you not only use words to describe what your data means but also the context in which your data appears.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Easy to use</b></td>
    <td>We rely heavily on vanilla GraphQL and RESTful interfaces. We believe in a superior developer user experience and try to make it as easy as possible to use Weaviate</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Decentralized knowledge graphs (P2P-network)</b></td>
    <td>If desired, you can create a decentralized P2P-network of many Weaviates. This is especially handy when you want to share data or to make specific knowledge graph architectures.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Modular data storage</b></td>
    <td>Because Weaviate can be used for many use cases where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem" target="_blank">consistency, availability and partition tolerance</a> play different roles, we want to make it as easy as possible to use multiple databases to store your data.</td> 
  </tr>
</table>
