## Concept

Weaviate is a [Decentralised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) [Semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) [Knowledge Graph](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-knowledge-graph-a16603a1a25f). It allows for different nodes in a network to share knowledge from each node's individual graph.

What makes Weaviate unique;<br>
- Weaviate is plug & playable because it uses industry standards like [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)'s and [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL).
- Every Weaviate can have a 100% unique ontology.
- [Can be connected](#user-content-database-connector--graph-interface) to any database of choice to solve specific use cases ([consistency, availability and/or partition tolerance wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)).
- Based on [word embedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) to give context to [M2M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_to_machine) communication over the network.

[More abstract concept description](https://bob.wtf/semantic-internet-of-things-42811e1ca7a7).

### Why Use Weaviate?

Weaviate solves the problem of relating seemingly different datasets to each other. It can be used to compare and describe data ranging from finance 🏦 to car manufacturing 🚗🏭, from zoos 🐘 to space stations 🚀 and from traditional datasets 📊 to Internet of Thing 📱 devices.

Besides doing that inside a single Weaviate instance. You can also create a peer-to-peer network of Weaviates that use word embeddings to communicate with each other in a unique way.

## Architecture

_The architecture of Weaviate is based on a core set of design principles which consists of the graph, the P2P network, and the word embeddings._

### Design Principles

Weaviate is build with the following axioms in mind;

1. Proven standards (i.e., RESTful, http(s) and GraphQL) should be sufficient.
2. Every Weaviate can have a unique ontology for both Things and Actions.
3. Every Weaviate can have a unique database underlying it.
4. Every Weaviate has a word embedded vector that gives context to questions posed over the network.
5. Every Weaviate can communicate vector coordinates over a https based P2P network.

### Overview

![Architectural overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/develop/assets/img/arch_overview.jpg "Architectural overview")

The above diagram contains a bird's eye view overview of Weaviate. Both human to machine and M2M communication is done over the RESTful endpoint. The ontology is validated through the semantic interface which translates all humanly readable requests into vector-based requests. 

### Database Connector & Graph Interface

Weaviate can support any database of your choosing. In the table below there is an overview of Weaviate functions that need to be implemented per database. In the folder [`/connectors`](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/tree/master/connectors) you can find all available connectors. There is a template which you can use to create a new connector called [foobar](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/blob/develop/connectors/foobar/connector.go) (documentation included inline). You can also [take inspiration](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/blob/develop/connectors/cassandra/connector.go) from the full-fledged Cassandra connector. In case of questions, please use [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/weaviate) or [Github](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/issues).

> Currently Weaviate only support Cassandra. Feel free to add or [request](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/issues/new) new connectors.

### Ontology

Every Weaviate instance needs to have two ontologies, one for Things and one for Actions. Ontologies are always; class-, property-, value-based and classes and properties are enriched by a keyword.

| Name             | Type     | Should be in Vector? | Mandatory? | Description |
| ---------------- |:--------:|:--------------------:|:----------:|-------------|
| Class            | `string` | `true`               | `true`     | Noun for Things (i.e., "Place"), verb for action (i.e., "Bought" or "Buys") |
| Class keyword    | `array`  | `true`               | `false`    | An array of descriptions relative to the class. (i.e., the class "Place" might gave: "City" as a keyword) |
| Property         | `string` | `true`               | `true`     | Property of the class. (i.e., "name" for "City") |
| Property keyword | `array`  | `true`               | `false`    | An array of descriptions relative to the class. (i.e., the class "Place" might gave: "City" as a keyword) |
| Value            | `string` | `false`              | `true`     | Value or refererence. |

#### Keyword Characteristics in the Ontology

Keywords are used to determine the context of the word, based on the location of the word in the vector space.

Keywords are always stored in an array containing a weight. The keyword itself should be available in the vector space. The weights are -based on the chosen algorithm- used to determine the location of the class or property that the word depicts.

The following excerpt depicts how the location in the vector space is determined to represent a "place that people live in."

```
...
"class": "Place",
"description": "This is a place that people live in",
"keywords": [
  {
    "keyword": "city",
    "weight": 0.9
  },
  {
    "keyword": "town",
    "weight": 0.8
  },
  {
    "keyword": "village",
    "weight": 0.7
  },
  {
    "keyword": "people",
    "weight": 0.2
  }
],
...
```

_Note:_<br>
Both [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) and camelCase are interpreted as being two words. Snake_case will be interpreted as one word and most probably will not be available in the vector space.

_Note II:_<br>
Although there is no distinction being made in the vector space between uppercase and lowercase. It is advised to keep classes CamelCase (or start with capital) and properties camelCase (start with lower).

#### Value Types

List of value types as defined in the ontologies;

```json
[{
    "name": "testString",
    "@dataType": [
      "string"
    ],
    "description": "Value of testString."
  },

### Semantic P2P Network

Weaviate is an HTTPS-based Semantic P2P network. The network allows Weaviates to communicate based on their ontologies and word vectors.

The P2P network operates in the following fashion;

![Semantic P2P network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/develop/assets/img/arch_semP2PNetwork.jpg "Semantic P2P network")

1. Genesis Weaviate collects vector from storage.
2. New Weaviate makes itself known on `POST /peers`.
3. If accepted, the Weaviate that received the request sends the vector file and network meta-data to the Weaviate node _and_ broadcasts the new Weaviate meta-data to the complete network.
4. A new Weaviate can make itself known to any Weaviate node on the network.
5. If accepted, the Weaviate that received the request sends the vector file and network meta-data to the Weaviate node _and_ broadcasts the new Weaviate meta-data to the complete network.
6. If the new Weaviate is unknown to the receiving node, the node broadcasts the meta-data to all other known nodes. This recurs until all nodes are informed.

### Semantic P2P Questionnaire

Weaviate communicates to each other node over the `/peers/*` endpoint on the HTTPS P2P network. Nodes don't communicate with actual values, but with vector representations of the classes and keywords.

![Semantic Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/develop/assets/img/arch_semInterface.jpg "Semantic Interface")

Weaviate uses 300-dimensional [word vector representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) that define the context of the request. The keywords and the weights of the keywords define the centroid of the vector.

An example of creating a vector on Ubuntu can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate-vector-generator).
